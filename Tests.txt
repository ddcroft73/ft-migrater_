# test_fakes.py

# Just a list of what ive tested so as not to forget any... I know its not very professional
# ft-migrater was tested more heavily from day one. Most of these tests were done to make sure the demo
# didnt leave files\directories behind and delete the wrong things. 

# Basic testing ive done. Nothing automated. By the time i discovered automation  i had no clue how to
# even start. I get the basic idea but I THINK for its purpose this app is pretty solid. Will employ automation
# for the testing and a good library next time.

# WARNING  The file, demo.log contains the names of the directories to be remoed by the --dir command and --cleanall. The program will not append 
# any names that are not associated with the demo, or any directory names that are not safe to be deleted. But does not check to see if they were 
# put there by the program before deletion. DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE BY HAND, with any other directory names.
# THe program validates the paths for existence only and will delete any path that exists in the log
# DONT Fuck around with this file and then run a clean up
