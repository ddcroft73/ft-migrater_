This script uses a CLI to generate directories and bogus files to demomstrate the use of the ft-migrater.

  Create a path to use as a home\start path in which to move files out of.
  Create as many fake files as needed to demo the migration of files by type over the computer.
  Create a destinaiton path to use as a location to migrate into
    (depending on the types generated, a directory for each will be created.)
  Cleanup all created diirectories and files after the demo.
  Only a Home\Start path is required to run the demo. THe files may be moved anywhere into 
  existing directories if desired. 

Usage:  --flag<homepath> <numfiles> <destinationpath>
   Fluff for demo:
       C:\home\path 100 C:\Destination\path
       <homepath>         required
       <numfiles>         may be omitted. default is 10
       <destinationpath>  may be omitted. Wil not be created. Assumes user will use existing directories.
    
   Cleanup:
