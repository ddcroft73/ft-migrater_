# ft-migrater_


<b> A simple file migration app with GUI. Given a directory full of different files, exports the 
 files across the computer using destinations set by the user. This application was created due to a need
to constantly move and sift through the files in 2 folders populated by different scraper\file downloaders. It 
allows me to view what files have been downloaded, delete any trash, and move them in bulk as needed. and to add delete support for new or old file types.</b>
       <br><br>
  Basic features as per user requirements: <br><br>
    GUI will display all files and directories of a predefined path. <br>
    Ability to move selected files to Recycle Bin. <br>
    Easy Selection of file types and destinantions. <br>

    Ability to Add, Delete, Update destinations for a file type<br>

     (when a file is selected a destination will display if an instruction has been set<br>
     remain blank if not)<br>
    Only files in the path to be sorted, "sort path" will be regarded.<br>
    JSon file viewer (the instructions can be hand edited and the program will adhere)<br>
