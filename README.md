# ft-migrater_

A simple file migration app with GUI. Given a directory full of different files, exports the  files across the computer using destinations set by the user. This application was created for a specific user due to the needto constantly move and sift through the files in changing folders populated by different scraper\file downloaders. It  allows you to view what files have been downloaded, delete any trash, and move them in bulk as needed. Ability to add\ delete support for new or old file types.
       
  ## Basic features as per user requirements: <br><br>
   - GUI will display all files and directories of a predefined path. 
   - Ability to move selected files to Recycle Bin. 
   - Easy Selection of file types and destinantions. 
   - Complete no typing interface. (Destnations may still be typed.)
     If a destination does not exist, it will be created.
     (new directories can be quickly created by first selecting the parent directory)
   - Quick navigation of the instructions with real time updating. 
   - Ability to Add, Delete, Update destinations for a file type.
   - Ability to change the path of the folder being sorted.
   - Widgets should update according to any relative info, and only relative info
     (when a file is selected a destination will display if an instruction has been set
     remain blank if not)
   - Only files in the path to be sorted, "sort path" will be regarded.
   - JSon file viewer (the instructions can be hand edited and the program will adhere)
   
 In its simplest terms this program is a Json editor that uses the data to carry out <br>
 the export of all relevent file types .
